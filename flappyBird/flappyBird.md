I followed Jaryt Bustards tutorial for creating a Flappy Bird clone in Java, check out his code
https://github.com/Jaryt/FlappyBirdTutorial/blob/master/flappyBird/FlappyBird.java

I changed the color palette and some values to e.g. increase the game speed, also added final score to the Game Over screen.
